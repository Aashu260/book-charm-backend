# Project Title: Book Charm

## Project Overview:

BookCharm is a modern book platform designed for book enthusiasts to explore, browse, and manage their favorite reads. The website offers users a seamless experience to view book details, manage their cart, and place orders.

### Installation Instructions (Backend)

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Aashu260/book-charm-backend

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install dependencies: npm install

4. Install additional dependencies: npm install express mongoose dotenv

5. Set up MongoDB connection: Copy your Mongo URI and add it to your .env file in the project root.

6. Start the backend server: node index.js

7. Verify the API: Open your browser and navigate to the API endpoint: http://localhost:3000

Add these endpoints to the frontend environment to fetch and display data as needed.

### Additional Notes:

- Make sure MongoDB is up and running, and verify that itâ€™s correctly connected to the backend server.
- If you encounter issues while starting the server, check the installed dependencies and ensure the MongoDB connection string in the .env file is accurate.
